  * Making A Better Manyland Experience.
  * In this documentation we'll be going through how to use BetterML as well as what each modification does individually.
  * There's quite a bit to cover so feel free to jump around to what you're needing guidance on.




## Getting Started
 * To get started using BetterML, open your settings menu and scroll to the very bottom.
 * You should see *three* new categories in your settings menu: Sound Extras, Performance, and BetterML.
 * To enable a modification simply click its toggle and enjoy!
