## Image Importer
 * Adds a new button in the painter that enables you to import images via URLS. 
 * Ensure that your selected image ends with a `.png, .jpeg, .jpg` for the importer to function properly.
 * To save the creation you _must_ include the word `"import"` in your creations name, otherwise it will not save.
 * Many members of the community have cited that this modification may be against the Manyland TOS, and while I have tried to place restrictions on how it can be used to better conform to those terms, please still use it with caution and at your own discretion.

## Speech to Text
 * Allows you to talk instead of type!
 * Simply ensure that your microphone is plugged in and that Manyland has been granted access to it.
 * Try speaking clearly and at a slower pace for the absolute best results! And yes it has a profranity filter, I'd turn it off if I could but apparently its a google api thing
